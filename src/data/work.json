            "description": "I spent a summer building React components for a piece of software for a Halifax based software development company focusing on aviation software, Vmo Solutions. It was my first time working with a small team and I really enjoyed the ease of asking for help or input. I learned a very important user experience concept of testing what you built as if you were the client. This means being prepared for the user to, for example, input all kinds of weird characters into a text field. I got to learn a lot of aviation terms as well as how airports manage flight operations and crew. ✈️✈️✈️"

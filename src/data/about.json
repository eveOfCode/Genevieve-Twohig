            "text": "Hi there! My name is Genevieve! Although I consider myself a citizen of the world, I grew up in Indonesia and am currently living in Canada. I'm in my 4th year at Acadia University, Nova Scotia. My love of solving problems, whether they be math or computer science related, probably stems from reading my library of almost 60 Agatha Christie books as well as all of the Sherlock Holmes stories. Although reading mysteries are still fun, I'm ready to tackle problems that exist in society and the world.",
